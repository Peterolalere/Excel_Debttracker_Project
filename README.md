### Project Overview

This project analyzes historical U.S. debt trends, calculates yearly and monthly debt changes, projects future debt growth, and compiles key insights to track national debt development over time.

### Data Source

Debts Data: The primary data used for this analysis is the "US Debt Tracker Project.xlsx" file, containng detailed information about public and governmental debt by the US government.

### Tools

- Excel - Data cleaning and creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparartion phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Clean the data by removing duplicates and handled missing values
3. Standardized Date and Debt Formats

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves exploring the debts data to answer key questions such as :

- What was the Yearly Debt Percentage Increase for each year compared to the previous year?
- Which months historically have seen the highest/lowest increases in Total debt?
- What is the projected growth of the publicly held debt in the next few years?

### Data Analysis

These are some interesting insights and steps I worked

```excel
Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicate values.
Handled missing data 
Standardized column names and formatted data types properly.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used Pivot Tables to analyze trends across different categories.
Created summary statistics (mean, median, mode, min, max) using Excel functions.
Applied conditional formatting to highlight key patterns.

Visualization:

Created bar charts and line graphs to visualize key trends.
Used scatter plots to identify correlations between variables.
Implemented slicers in Pivot Tables for better interactivity.
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. For the total public debt outstanding,in years 2016-2019, the average increase was 5%.
2. In 2020, we see a large spike that was mostly caused by pandemic responses in the US.
3. Highest debts increases months historically occur during the month of January,Febuarry,November and December Lowest debts increases months historically occur during the month of April, May,June and July.
4. During high months, there are holodays in the US such as thanksgiving, xmas & new year that people historically spend money buying gifts for others.People take out debts for these months to buy these gifts.
5. During low months, there are no holidays,so people are taking on less debts during this time.
6. From 1997 to 2007, we saw an increase of about 1 trillion in publicly held debt.
7. From 2008 to 2019 debt increased from 6 trillion to 17trillion.
8. From 2020 to 2022 debt increased from 21.5 to25 trillion.
9. From 2023 to 2027 it is projected that publicly held debt will increase to 33 trillion.

### Conclusion

In conclusion,publicly held debt is projected to increase at a steady increased rate over the 5 years.
